/*2. 
Purpose of Constraints
Constraints help maintain data integrity by enforcing rules at the database level. 
Examples include:-

PRIMARY KEY: Ensures uniqueness and prevents NULL values.
FOREIGN KEY: Enforces referential integrity between tables.
NOT NULL: Prevents missing values in a column.
CHECK: Ensures specific conditions (e.g., age â‰¥ 18).
UNIQUE: Prevents duplicate values in a column.
NOT NULL & Primary Key Constraints
*/

/*3
NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot store NULL values.
A PRIMARY KEY cannot contain NULL values because it uniquely identifies each record. 
A NULL value would mean an undefined identity, violating uniqueness.*/
